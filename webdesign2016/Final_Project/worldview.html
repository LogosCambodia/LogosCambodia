<h1>A Criminal's Worldview</h1>

<b>
<p>
<div id="paragraph1">Kamryn came from a Christian background and is allegedly following in the footsteps of her parents. She believes in the ressurection of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, and in our purpose on Earth as glorification for God. Our lives have no meaning apart from God, and through him, we can make even the mountains move. She knows that the world was created in 7 days with one day as rest; Adam and Eve were the first humans and were given charge of the Earth and were perfect, but their sin caused the world to fall into eternal darkness for everyone, unless they follow God. Kamryn also believes in a Heaven and Hell; Heaven is a place where followers of Christ will wait until a new Jerusalem is built, and Hell is a place where the people who refused to accept God and followed the way of man will suffer in pain and agony for eternity.</div>
