		<p>I believe in pragmatism. People should concoct practical approaches to their goals. Oscar Wilde, the world renowned author and a playwright pundit, once orated that pragmatism offers solutions to daily life quandries. As Wilde has testified, although some mavericks might contend that idealism has its own scintillating effects, pragmatism prevents one from becoming overly quixotic. Pragmatism offers solutions to the commonplace predicaments and tangible consequences.</p>
