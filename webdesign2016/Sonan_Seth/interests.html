<p> My main interest and hobby is music. In particular, electronic music production. I have been producing since I was in middle school and currently devote a large chunk of my free time to the craft. Over the years, I have acquired a fair amount of gear and have a small home studio in my bedroom. My main instruments are Ableton Live 9, various synthesizers, guitar and piano. I currently own 5 guitars and various MIDI controllers. I usually produce music that is somewhere between electronic music and hip hop, sometimes known as "wonky" "beat music" and "abstract beats". Other than that, I also enjoy producing Uk Garage, Drum and Bass, Ambient, Neurofunk and occasionally Vaporwave.
