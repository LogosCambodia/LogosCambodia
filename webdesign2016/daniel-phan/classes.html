This is accomplished through a critique of basic beliefs by examining uncritically held presuppositions about life. In the first unit, the students will be exposed to principles of basic philosophy. As the students continue to examine basic beliefs, the course moves to a basic presentation and critique of the defense of theistic and Christian basic beliefs. The course is, therefore, a blend of basic philosophy and Christian apologetics.</p></div><br>		<div id="blit">		<p>				<strong> British Literature: </strong>				<br>				 This course aims to familiarize students with a range of British literature, moving chronologically from Anglo-Saxon poetry to the modern novel.

Students will be expected to do homework problems and additional problems at the end of each chapter to solidify the concepts that are taught in class.  Students will also use mathematical equations and diagrams to explore these concepts and physical laws.  For each chapter, there is an experiment that allows students to reinforce their understanding of physics laws in nature and to give them hands-on experiences. In addition, they will analyse the interrelationships between physics and technology, and consider the impact of technological applications of physics on society and the environment.  Students who take this course should be comfortable using and rearranging simple algebraic equations.				<br>						<p>		</div>			<button id="toggler7">Hide/Show Physics</button>		<script>			$( "#toggler7" ).click(function() {				$( "#phys").toggle("slow", function(){				console.log("Is it visible?

The primary purpose of the course is to develop a better understanding of the events, people, and places throughout history that caused our world to become what it is today.   The curriculum of the course is both content and skill based.  Students are expected to gain knowledge of significant historical facts and to apply the skills of an historian to the study of these facts.  Among these skills are those of analyzing primary source documents, making comparisons between major societies, and determining the ways societies both change and stay the same.  These skills require the student to be a critical and creative thinker.  Additionally, students should be able to see the ways in which the “Five Themes of History” connect elements over all of world history.				<br>						<p>		</div>			<button id="toggler8">Hide/Show APWH</button>		<script>			$( "#toggler8" ).click(function() {				$( "#world").toggle("slow", function(){				console.log("Is it visible?
