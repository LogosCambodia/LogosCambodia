I am not sure exactly about when or how he did, but I strongly believe in an intelligent design.				<br>				<br>			<strong> What does it mean to be a human being?</strong>				<br>					To be a human being means to be made in the image of God. We are all in the line of a rational being, and so in a sense any physical descendant of a human being is a human. It means to be set apart from all other things in the universe as we have a soul and our choices reflect our acceptance or denial of our creator.				<br>				<br>			<strong> What happens when you die?</strong>				<br>					Physical death is when you are no longer able to function as a human, your heart stops beating, and your brain stops thinking. At that moment you are faced with judgement and you will be in a state of seperation or union with God.			<p1>		</div>        	<div id="return_worldview">			<br>			<a href="index.html">Return</a>		</div>	</body></html>
