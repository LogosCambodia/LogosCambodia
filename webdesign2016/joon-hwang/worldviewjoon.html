	<h2> how was the universe created? </h2>
	i believe that the universe was created by god with an ultimate, chief, and original end (purpose).
	<br>
	my biblical thinking class is really coming handy now.

	<h2> what does it mean to be a human being? </h2>
	to be a human being means to exist on this earth for god.

	<h2> what happens when you die? </h2>
	your body decomposes. your soul's destination depends.
	<br>
	i am still trying to figure out some things about my worldview.
	<br>
	as a result, these may change anytime.
