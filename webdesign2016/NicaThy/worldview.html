<b> How was the universe created? </b>
<br>
  I think the Universe was created in God's image and power by himself.
  Maybe, God had already planned everything in his head and then by snapping,
   everything in this universe appears just as the way he wanted except
   for our sins.
 </br>
<br>
<b>   What does it mean to be a human being? </b>
 <br>
   I believe that the definition of a human being is to take care of God's
   creation and to reflect God's characteristics throughout our life. I also
   believe that to be a human being is to not be perfect, but to "try,fail,and
   repeat again ;)" because no one is perfect in this world.
 </br>
 <br>
 <b> What happens when you die? </b>
 <br>
 I really don't know the answer to that question because I have never
 experience death before, but for sure there's Heaven and Hell out there waiting
 for your death.
