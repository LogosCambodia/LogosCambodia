		<br>
		<p>I believe that the universe was created by an eternal being - a being that had no beginning and has no end. He created everything including the universe, Earth, and us.
	I think being a human being is trying to pursue knowledge about the eternal being and try glorify Him through everything we do.
	Finally, when humans die they become everlasting spirits that either go to heaven or hell. In heaven they will keep glorifying God and will live a happy and peaceful life. While those who go to hell will suffer in its flames for eternity.</p>
