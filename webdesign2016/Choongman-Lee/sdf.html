		<br>
		<p>I have many interests such as basketball, movies, music, and books. Basketball is considered to be my favorite sport, since
		I am not good at other sports and I have made many new relationships by playing basketball with other people. I like to watch movies and listen
		to music because they provide relaxation and entertainment at the same time. Reading books is another way I spend my free time. I mainly read
		fictional books because they enhance my imagination.</p>
