    <h2>How was universe created?</h2>
<p>Most astronomers think that during the Big Bang, the Universe was created,
   They believe that a giant explosion hurled matter in all directions and caused space itself to expand.
   And as the Universe cooled, the material in it combined to form galaxies, stars, and planets. But no one actually knows how the universe was created becuase, no humans were alive during the time the universe was created.  </p>
      <h2>What does it mean to be a human being?</h2>
      <p>I think being a human being means to have a mind, heart, body, brain, and soul.
      </p>
      <h2>What happens when you die?</h2>
        <p>When you die, you either go to heaven or hell.
