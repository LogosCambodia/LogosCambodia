	<h1>The Worldveiw of Girl.</h1>
	<p  id="first-paragraph"> <span class="indented"/> "With great knowledge comes great responsibilty." Put a little twist on her buddy Spiderman's favorite phrase, and you've got Secretcrimefighter's life-sentence. Her world veiw is God, which is about the most humbling-est thing Girl knows, as she acknowledges the fact that compared to <em>that</em> Hero, she is reduced to a miserable lump of utter nothingness, more lowly than her ordinary adorers she so fondly labels inferiors.
    <br> <span class="indented"/> The universe was created by this Hero, and though Girl's logic of life often revolves around heros and villains on earth, pretty much all human beings are the same thing: lost souls that each need a real Hero. When these flesh-poeple die, their souls will live on, and how they live depends on the choice they make as the physical, worldly fleshlings. But Secretcrimefighter Girl often would rather contemplate simpler things like the number of cool-looking gadgets that make up her suit (you might have noticed that philosophy was not an available course at her academy).</p>
