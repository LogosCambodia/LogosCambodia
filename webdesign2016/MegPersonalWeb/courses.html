		<p>NOTE: It is important for us to inform you that Secretcrimefighter Girl will be in full uniform while teaching in all of these classes, lest any spies use her secret identity against her rarely-vulnerable hero-ness. We warn you all of this in order to prevent students from arriving unprepared to the intimidating sight of a suit so obviously full of sheer power and fashionable authority. We must ask that you leave cameras in your bags until after class when you will be able to ask for her signature as well. Also, Secretcrimefighter Girl wishes to let all of her future students know that if her true name is too long and humbling to say, you may simply call her Thy Protector of Righteousness, Skillful Woman. She does not wish, however, that you call her "Teacher" or "Ms. Girl", as "I don't want my students to feel I'm any better than them," says Secretcrimefighter Girl at her weekly interview for Time's magazine, "so I try to leave any undermining aspects out of my titles." We wish and know that you will enjoy feeding your minds with the knowledgeable words of your favorite hero. <em>Yours sincerely, The Recruited</em>.</p>
    <p id="first-paragraph">WARNING: Note to those planning to join the Order Placement: The Basics of Each Type course: Those who are labeled "Heros" by the end of the course often become Heros. Those who are labled "Villains" often also become Heros, in an act of defiance to the label they were given, because Villains defy things. Those who left the course with the labels "Sidekicks" and "Minions" often turn into Villains, in bitter resentment at being given such a lowly and submissive title. Minions and Sidekicks today are a result of the Recruitment course taken by Heros and Villains. We must inform you that we are not responsible for life-changement, psychological consequences, or the direction your soul may take following this course. <em>Thank you, the Recruited.</em> </p>
