<div id="a3"> Reincarnation seems very possible to me. The idea of being able to start over and over again is just beautiful to me. This explains a lot. It explains why some people are born with
  disabilities. It explains why people have to suffer. But mostly, it explains how sometimes when you meet someone and you just click. Like, their soul is just so familiar. It's as if you danced
  and laughed and drank together in a prior life. I don't know, but I've experienced a lot of things in my life that point directy to reincarnation. </div>
