        <h1> How was the universe created?</h1>
        <p> I believe the universe was created by God before Earth was created. I think God took time to create every single part of the universe and added all the planets and galaxies and gave them their own characteristic.</p>
          <h1>What does it mean to be a human being?</h1>
          <p> For me, being a human means to live my life for His glory. To do what He created me to do which is to glorify His name and to spread His words.</p>
          <h1>What happens when you die?</h1>
          <p> I think God is the ultimate judge. As the Bible tells us, there is Heaven and Hell. God will judge where you go when your time comes. I think the Bible tells us that God will reward us for what we do on Earth. This means He will judge what we do here and that will determine where we go. </p>
