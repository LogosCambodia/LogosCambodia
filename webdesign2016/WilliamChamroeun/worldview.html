	<h1>My Worldview</h1>
	<h2>How Was The Universe Is Created?</h2>
<p>According to science, it all started with a bang, a big bang. It was this big bang that created everything that we know of now. This theory is very popular with people nowadays but for me, I'm more of what they call a creationist, someone who believes that the Earth was created not that long ago and by a almight being, which is God.</p>
	<h2>What does is mean to be a human being?</h2>
<p>To be a human being is to feel, to have a free will, to talk, to interact, to sleep, to eat, to be happy, to be sad, but the biggest one of them all is to love.</p>
	<h2>What happens when you die?</h2>
<p>When you die, your body becomes lifeless. There will be no heart beat in your body. Your body will start to decay the minute you're dead. You're whole will be just a useless piece of meat and bones. As for your soul, it wil either go to heaven or hell through the judgement of God.</p>
